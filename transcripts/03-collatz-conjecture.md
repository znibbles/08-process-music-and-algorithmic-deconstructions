## Collatz Conjecture

Lately I've come across an interesting problem in mathematics, the _Collatz conjecture_. Let's look it up in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture):

> The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer $n$. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of $n$, the sequence will always reach 1.

More precisely, a recurring cycle of the integers $4, 2, 1$.

When I read something about recurring sequences of numbers, I immediately think about sound, or how to make it audible.
